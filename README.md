# 100DaysOfPython
I am currently participating in 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022. This repo serves as a way for me to showcase the skills I've learned through projects that I've worked on, and it will continue to be updated as I further progress and develop my skillset within Python.
