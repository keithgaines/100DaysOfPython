# password_generator
Python language password generator 

This reposity is 2 different solutions to the password generator project as part of the #100DaysofCode Python bootcamp. Version 1 is my initial solution. Version 2 is the way the course intended us to solve it using "for loops." Both versions work to create a random string of letters, symbols, and numbers based on user provided input stating how many of each type of character should be used in the password. Each version just uses a different method to achieve the same end result.
